Question: Modelling basic objects using standard primitives

Basic Steps:

1\. Dragged and dropped necessary objects from standard properties.

2\. Edited the object as required, arraigned and aligned the objects. Crop the cone to get the desired shape.

3\. Used different shapes like cylinder, torus, cone, textplus, donut, box, tube.

4\. Sliced the tube to get the fold.

5\. Changed the environment looks like added shadow.

6\.  Added base and lamps to make it look more attractive.

7\. Overall became a complete and beautiful design.
