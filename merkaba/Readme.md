Editing shapes with meshes

Basic Steps:

1\. Dragged and dropped necessary objects from standard properties.

2\. Edited the object as required, arraigned and aligned the objects. Created and aligned the cube by using 12 edges using box. Added glass around the cube to make it look like a relic.

3\. The Red merkaba is created using 8 hedra and editing its Q family parameter to get a hexahedra structure. Arranging the 8 hexahedra structure to the specific arrangement  to obtain the special structure called merkaba.

4\. The special orange base was created using a cube and then converting it to editable poly so that we can break apart and removing the edges and points to obtain the special structure. Even bridging of the points was also done. 

5\. Changed the environment looks like shadow and other effects. (Please note for program requirements each object was individually made and then joined and perfectly aligned.)
